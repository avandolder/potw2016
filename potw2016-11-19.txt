Yes, you can gain admin access without entering the correct password.
This is due to the fact that the "secret" string is stored in memory following the "name" string,
and since you can enter a string of any length as a name, despite "name" being limited to 20
characters, you can enter 20 characters as name, and then continues to enter characters to overwrite
the "secret" string to be any string. This allows you to change the password and thus gain access
without entering the correct password.
