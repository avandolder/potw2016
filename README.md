# UWindsor Problem of the Week

This is a collection of some of my solutions to the problem of the week program
that was ran by the Computer Science Society at the University of Windsor
during the 2016-2017 school year. The problems (and solutions) were once
available at potw.quinnftw.com, but unfortunately the site is no longer up and
only some of the pages were cached at archive.org.
